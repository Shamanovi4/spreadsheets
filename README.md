# Spreadsheets
Based of a JavaScript Course this project was done and enhanced by me to develop and consolidate my vanilla JS skills. The goal of this project was to create vanilla JS framework from scratch and then create some kind of Google Spreadsheets clone.

# Features:
- Creating, editing, deleting spreadsheet.
- Storing spreadsheet with localStorage.
- Displaying spreadsheets list with the last visit date.
- Selecting cell or group of cell (area select works while pressing 'Shift' + 'LMB' or pressing and holding 'LMB').
- Changing cell or group of cells styles.
- Resizing rows or columns.
- Using formulas like '=2+2', '=2*2'. There are no formulas that uses several cells like '=sum'.

# To Do:
- More styling for cells like font, font size, color, etc.
- Custom scroll for grid that scrolls by cells.
- Formulas for several cells like '=sum', etc.
- Displaying of what cell or cells are selected by showing their ids.
